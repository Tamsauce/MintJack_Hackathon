## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** [React], HTML, CSS, JavaScript, [Twitter Bootstrap], [Node.js]

Working as a team in different time zones we decided to split the work to maximize our efforts.

While we were able to finish the project and blog about our journey in the time allotted there is always room for optimization.  If we had more time we would have ...

## Lessons Learned:

The main lesson we learned from this project was the importance of over-communicating with a team.  Since we are all in different time zones, and total strangers, we had to be very detailed regarding our progress.  We also choose to schedule out small windows of time for daily checkins.  Implenting trust in our team was the first thing we "**installed**". 

## Installation:

```sh
- Clone repository using the command git clone 
- Run the command _npm_ _install_ to install all dependencies 
- Run the command _npm_ _start_ to run the app locally 
- The app will automatically open in your browser on the following url http://localhost:300
```
